In this lab, you will build models to perform image colourization. That is, given a greyscale image, we wish to predict the colour at each pixel. Image colourization is a difficult problem for many reasons, one of which being that it is ill-posed: for a single greyscale image, there can be multiple, equally valid colourings.
